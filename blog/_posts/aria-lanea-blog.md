## Outline

## Project Intro

## Documentation

## Testing
When you're going to be writing testing for a large project with multiple dependencies, the best place to start is by figuring out what you should test first. 

- Levelization and bottom up
    - Austin's vizualization of MABE2
    - Assuming everything in Empirical was working correctly
    - Flowchart process (insert the flowchart Austin made)
        - Why use this?
- Using CATCH2
    - Words of Wisdom (what was easy/hard)
        - Assert issue
        - What to look for when testing
        
## Wrap Up
At the end of the WAVES internship, we were given the opportunity to present our summer of work at the BEACON congress. 

- What is BEACON?
- Include video of our talk?

## Thank you!
